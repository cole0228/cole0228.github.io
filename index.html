                            <p>Izze is a very fun and bubbly drink which I wanted to be reflected in the design. It is a drink for those who are more health conscious so I wanted to show this through the imagery. All of the images except for the product shots were photographed or created by me. For the design of the whole campaign I wanted to keep things visually simple and clean, as well as bright. Every design decision works together to create a campaign where each ad can work separately or together.</p>

                        <h4 id="animatters">Animatters</h4>
                            <p>Motion and design were important aspects to combine into the creation of this logo. The logo was designed to show motion with the different line weights. The A and M of Animatters was also built into the logo artwork with the swoosh going through the triangle creating the A. The heart beat rate at the bottom creates the M. The heart beat rate was included into the design to represent the companies design concepts of bring other companies back to life, re-branding. The design reflects the company and brings it into the present and future.</p>

                            <p>The Dancing Don’s logo needed to reflect the company that it is and always will be while bring the company some new creative life. The old logo was a bit outdated, so the new logo keeps with the fun and creative aspects of the wood working furniture company while giving the company a new look and feel.</p>

                            <p>This is an article about 9/11 and a list of songs that was sent out to radio stations. This list of songs were songs that were deemed inappropriate. I have long columns of text in contrast to the shorter text to represent the twin towers. The article tittle reads like a song, a design choice reflecting one of the main subjects of the article.</p>

                            <p>The quote I chose to design is, "Cash flow is the life blood of a business. Bad clients are vampires.” Because it seemed like it would inspire interesting designs. You can’t have a business without money. You would have no way to pay anyone or buy any supplies. The design of the poster pretty much reflects all of this.</p>
