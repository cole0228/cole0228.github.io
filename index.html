            <h3>Izze Campaign</h3>
            <h3>Animatters Logo</h3>
            <h3>Dancing Don's</h3>
                <h4>Izze Campaign</h4>
                    <p>Izze is a very fun and bubbly drink which I wanted to be reflected in the design. It is a drink for those who are more health conscious so I wanted to show this through the imagery. All of the images except for the product shots were photographed or created by me. For the design of the whole campaign I wanted to keep things visually simple and clean, as well as bright. The imagery plays a big part in the design because all of the colors are based off of the images. In each ad the images are different to show all of the many flavors that Izze has. Every design decision works together to create a campaign where each ad can work separately or together.</p>
