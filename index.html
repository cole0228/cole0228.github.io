                            <p>Izze is a very fun and bubbly drink which I wanted to be reflected in the design. It is a drink for those who are more health conscious so I wanted to show this through the imagery. All of the images except for the product shots were photographed or created by me. For the design of the whole campaign I wanted to keep things visually simple and clean, as well as bright. The imagery plays a big part in the design because all of the colors are based off of the images. In each ad the images are different to show all of the many flavors that Izze has. Every design decision works together to create a campaign where each ad can work separately or together.</p>

                            <p>The Animatters logo has been designed to reflect the Animation and Design Studios inc. company in both t’s ideals and designs. Motion and design were important aspects to combine into the creation of this logo. The logo also needed to be reproducible with both print and web design. The logo can also be reasonably reproduced at various sizes. The logo was designed to show motion with the different line weights. The A and M of Animatters was also built into the logo artwork with the swoosh going through the triangle creating the A. The heart beat rate at the bottom creates the M. The heart beat rate was included into the design to represent the companies design concepts of bring other companies back to life, re-branding. The design reflects the company and brings it into the present and future.</p>

                            <p>The Dancing Don’s logo needed to reflect the company that it is and always will be while bring the company some new creative life. The old logo was a bit outdated, so the new logo keeps with the fun and creative aspects of the wood working furniture company while giving the company a new look and feel.</p>

                            <p>This is an article about 9/11 and a list of songs that was sent out to radio stations. This list of songs were songs that were deemed inappropriate. I have long columns of text in contrast to the shorter text to represent the twin towers. The article tittle reads like a song, a design choice reflecting one of the main subjects of the article. I used minimal graphics so as not to overpower the text. On the last page you have 2 square boxes with song tittles from the list that was sent out. They are design this way to represent the 9/11 memorial site and what it looks like from an aerial view.</p>

                            <p>This is an informational booklet for the World Wildlife Fund. The theme for the booklet was to be natural and have lots of easy flow from one part to the next. The text needed to stand out from all the images so there is lots of negative space. The images are large enough to add interest, but not so large that they overpower the text. I chose to do a three column grid because the text flowed well in the initial planning. Using a three column grid helps me to easily layout the text and images; creating a very simple but effective layout for this booklet, making the content very readable.</p>

                            <p>This is a packaging design for the tea company Teavana. This company has a wide variety of teas so the packaging needs to be versatile, to be used with all of the teas. The tea would be stored in a glass jar because it is reusable and tea is very interesting and pretty to look at, so why not put it on display instead of hiding it in a tin? This is also why there are gaps in the sides of the box, this adds to the design and makes it interesting but this also allows you to see the tea.</p>

                        <h4>Orgoto App</h4>
                            <p>To organize and capture inspiring moments and things in life by taking pictures just for you so they don’t have to be perfect. its Declutteres your photo library, so those random little images you take, of designs and advertisements, don’t get lost. You can the organize these photos into project ‘folders’, add a little description.</p>
                            <p>You could be walking or you could be shopping and you see something that inspires you. So you take a picture and promptly forget about it. Wouldn’t it be nice to have an app that could take the photo and you could quickly organize it and write a brief note, maybe put it in a virtual projects folder, without having to worry about what the photo looks like? It declutters your phone photo library so those random littles images you take of designs and advertisements, don’t get lost and forgotten. It’s a mood board for everyday inspiration.</p>
                            <p>Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly.</p>

                            <p>This is basically what I would like the Orgoto app experience to be like. Open App. Take Photo. Go. Very simple and straight foreword. Obviously there are smaller tasks in between, but you do have the option of doing it later. These smaller steps would be creating a category or adding a description to the photo.</p>

                        <h4 id="quote">Quote Poster</h4>
                            <p>The quote I chose to design is, "Cash flow is the life blood of a business. Bad clients are vampires.” Because it seemed like it would inspire interesting designs. You can’t have a business without money. You would have no way to pay anyone or buy any supplies. To keep any company up and running you need the money to do so. Any business including charities need money to function. You also need clients to run a business. Without the clients there is no product or business. All clients want to save as much money as possible. There are also those clients that want to get as much out of you as they can without paying for it. This is why bad clients are vampires. They will take and take and they won’t expect that they have to pay for it. Many people feel that they should get design work for free, that it isn’t a viable business. This is however changing a lot. The design of the poster pretty much reflects all of this.</p>
